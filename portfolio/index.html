              <p>I am  <span>Masinde Sylvester</span>, a Junior Web Developer and experienced Graphic Designer passionate about creating digital experiences that are both visually stunning and functionally seamless. With a background in design and a growing expertise in development, I specialize in blending creativity with technology to deliver engaging, user-friendly websites and digital assets.As a 
                Web Developer, I work with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and interactive websites. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and ensuring excellent 
                user experience across all devices, always aiming for performance optimization and accessibility.
                <br>
                As a <span>Graphic Designer</span>, I bring 3 years of experience designing everything from branding and logos to marketing materials and web graphics. Skilled in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, 
                Illustrator, InDesign), I create designs that are not only visually appealing but also effectively communicate a brandâ€™s message.
                <br>
                By combining my design expertise with my developing coding skills, Iâ€™m able to approach projects from both a creative and technical perspective, ensuring that every website and design is both beautiful 
                and functional. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and refine my craft, and Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals or teams who value both design and development.
